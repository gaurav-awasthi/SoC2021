# SoC2021
Hey there! \
This is the repository I'm maintaining for my Summer of Code project under the IIT Bombay Web and Coding Club. \
The project essentially revolves around computer vision, with some neural networks thrown in for good measure. For this, I'm being mentored by Prayas Jain and Vanshika Gupta. \
This repository contains all of the tasks that I'm required to submit, and a brief report of everything I did. 

 
### Phase 1: 
Getting acquainted with Jupyter and Google Colab, fundamentals of python including numpy, pandas and seaborn. 
#### Checkpoint 1 (11 April, 2021): 
Task 1 [ID-A1]: Exercises using pandas. \
Task 2 [ID-A2]: Exercises using matplotlib.\
Task 3b [ID-B2]: Using seaborn to draw inferences from a dataset. 


### Phase 2: 
Getting started with OpenCV, neural networks, and the basics of PyTorch for deep learning. 
#### Checkpoint 2 (8 June, 2021): 
Task 4 [ID-B3]: Live age and gender detection from webcam. \
Task 5 [ID-B4]: Age and gender detection from a YouTube video. 


### Phase 3: 
Wrapping everything up, we had a choice between making a Gender and Age detection app using TFLite and Android Studio, and making a Google Colab based Face Recognition, Identification and Clustering notebook. I chose to do the second of these. 
#### Endterm Submission (18 July, 2021): 
Task 7 [ID-C2]: Google Colab based face recognition, identification, and clustering. \

Yeah, that's about it. \
Many thanks to my amazing mentors, and to WnCC for organising this. \
